    Vue's reactivity system does not detect changes to objects
        UNLESS the object is initialized with a property and ONLY THAT PROPERTY  is reactive!
        --------------
        For changes to that property to be detected:
        - a fresh object is created with the same property name as the original
        - the property is assigned a value
        - the new object is now used to replace the original object
        -------------
        By using this method, Vue is able to detect a change to the original property

    So 'false' (string) is used instead

    Each task is an object, placed in its parent (task category) which an array of all tasks of the same type.
    All task categorises are an item in thier parent, an ojbect
    I adopted this method to see that each task is an object, and so task categories can be named
