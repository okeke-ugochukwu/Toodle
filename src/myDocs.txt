#Ref-101
    Vue's reactivity system does not detect changes to objects
        UNLESS the object is initialized with a property and ONLY THAT PROPERTY  is reactive!
        --------------
        For changes to that property to be detected:
        - a fresh object is created with the same property name as the original
        - the property is assigned a value
        - the new object is now used to replace the original object
        -------------
        By using this method, Vue is able to detect a change to the original property
